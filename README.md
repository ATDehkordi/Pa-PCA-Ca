# Pa-PCA-Ca

## This is a JavaScript code in GEE for a novel ensemble structure for crop type classification using Remote Sensing satellite Data.

This ensemble structure is published in this paper:

A Parallel-Cascaded Ensemble of Machine Learning Models for Crop Type Classification in Google Earth Engine Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1/2 and Landsat-8/9 Remote Sensing Data.

Please cite this paper if you use the code and data: https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16010127 or https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/1/127

The code was developed under a collaboration with [@esmaielabdali](https://github.com/esmaielabdali).
A part of Ground Truth (GT) samples are also provided for model development and validation.
