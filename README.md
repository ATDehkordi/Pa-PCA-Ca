## This is a JavaScript code in GEE for a novel ensemble structure for crop type classification using Remote Sensing satellite Data.

## The code is developed under a collaboration with [@esmaielabdali](https://github.com/esmaielabdali).
 A part of Ground Truth (GT) samples are also provided for model development and validation.
